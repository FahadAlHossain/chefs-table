- **Persistent Cooking List:** Items remain in the cooking list after moving.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Immediate UI updates as users interact with the lists.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** for building user interfaces.
- **React State Management** for managing `cooks` and `cooking` states.
- **React Toastify** for user notifications.
- **CSS & Tailwind CSS** for styling.
